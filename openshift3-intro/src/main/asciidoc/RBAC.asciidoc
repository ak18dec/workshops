== User Role based access control

OpenShift maintains a comprehensive and configurable *RBAC* (Role Based Access Control) mechanism across the Objects within a Project. 

In order to discuss and understand this we need to understand the nature of *Users* and *Roles* within the OpenShift system. Their are actually two types of Users within a Project, the _Users_
which are physical Users, and _Service Accounts_ which are effectively internal 'virtual' Users that are used by OpenShift to actually execute tasks.

Think of _Service Accounts_ as proxy-users within the Project that are individually controlled and constrained on the _actions_ they can do within the Project. 
For example by default a Service Account is created within the Project with the following name - system:serviceaccount:*(PROJECT_NAME)*.default - this user is used to 
do the builds and deployments within the Project and has access to the Objects within the Project *and* the rights to perform a build, push to the registry in the name of this Project and deploy Containers.

Users themselves are bound by a visibility role that gives them different levels of visibility and accessability to the Objects within the Project. There are four distinct
tiers of access provided:

*Admin* - a user with Admin rights, which are applied to the creating User of a Project, can create and delete Objects within the Project and give and remove access rights to other Users.

*Edit* - a user with Edit rights can change the *value* of existing Objects within the Project but cannot create or delete Objects, or assign rights to other Users.

*Read* - a user with Read rights can see the values of existing Objects within the Project but cannot create or delete objects and cannot change the values of existing Objects either.

*None* - without being assigned rights to a Project a user has *no* visibility of the Project or the Objects within it.

Using the project dropdown, go back to the `Sandbox` project we create earlier.

Go to the menu:Resources[Membership] page. (using the left side menu)

You will see 3 tabs:

* *Users:* This should list your user (userX).
* *Groups:* - TODO: explain the difference between the full name system:serviceaccount:sandbox-userX and the 'all' groups system:serviceaccounts:projectName
* *Service Accounts* - TODO: explain the concept of a 'virtual' user within the namespace.

In the `Users` Tab, click btn:[Edit Membership] and add the attendee next to you as a user:

* *Name:* UserX+1
* *Roles:* admin

Click btn:[Add]

You will now see the project assigned to you in your Project list, 
example `User2` can see `sandbox-user-1` project:

(click on the OPENSHIFT CONTAINER PLATFORM logo)

Now do a build of the application in that project.

Next, let's remove the access from that user using CLI.

First make sure you are using the correct project:

[source,shell]
----
oc project sandbox-userX
----

Next remove the access:

[source,shell]
----
oc adm policy remove-role-from-user admin userX+1
----

Now go back to your project list and note that your access has been removed.
