== User Role based access control

****
IMPORTANT: *TODO*

Explain the nature of the user model in OCP compared to the visibility of objects.
Explain admin, edit, view and *no* access models

****

Using the project dropdown, go back to the `Sandbox` project we create earlier.

Go to the menu:Resources[Membership] page. (using the left side menu)

You will see 3 tabs:

* *Users:* This should list your user (userX).
* *Groups:* - TODO: explain the difference between the full name system:serviceaccount:sandbox-userX and the 'all' groups system:serviceaccounts:projectName
* *Service Accounts* - TODO: explain the concept of a 'virtual' user within the namespace.

In the `Users` Tab, click btn:[Edit Membership] and add the attendee next to you as a user:

* *Name:* UserX+1
* *Roles:* admin

Click btn:[Add]

You will now see the project assigned to you in your Project list, 
example `User2` can see `sandbox-user-1` project:

image::screenshot_users.png[User access]

(click on the OPENSHIFT CONTAINER PLATFORM logo)

Now do a build of the application in that project.

Next, let's remove the access from that user using CLI.

First make sure you are using the correct project:

[source,shell]
----
oc project sandbox-userX
----

Next remove the access:

[source,shell]
----
oc adm policy remove-role-from-user admin userX+1
----

Now go back to your project list and note that your access has been removed.
