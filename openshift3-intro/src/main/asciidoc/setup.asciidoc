=== Web console

You will be assigned an ID by the facilitator. At any time that the content refer to _userX_, (or _anythingX_) you need to replace X with your ID.
Your userId to log onto the web console will be _userX_ and the password will be _openshift_

You can access the web console using your browser:

{webConsoleUrl}[{webConsoleUrl}]

*Example:* If your ID is `1`:

* *Username:* user1
* *Password:* openshift

Click btn:[Log In]

[[setup-cli]]
=== CLI (oc)

With the OpenShift Enterprise command line interface (CLI), you can create applications and manage OpenShift projects from a terminal. 
The CLI is ideal in situations where you are:

* Working directly with project source code.
* Scripting OpenShift Enterprise operations.
* Restricted by bandwidth resources and cannot use the web console.

The CLI is available using the oc command:

[source,shell]
----
oc {command}
----

You have two options to get a working CLI. Either install `oc` on your localhost or use a docker image in OpenShift:

==== Option 1: Installing the CLI on localhost

The easiest way to download the CLI is by accessing the About page on the web console [ (?)-> About ]

or you can follow the instructions from the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html[official documentation]

==== Option 2: Use a pre-configured docker image on OpenShift

This option install and run a docker image inside OpenShift that already has oc installed and configured. 
To install this image, do the following:

* Login to the OCP system through the UI. (userX / openshift)
* Create a new project:
** *Name:* oconline-userX
** *Display Name:* OC Terminal

Click btn:[Create]

Select the newly created `OC Terminal` project and then select `Deploy Image`

Use the Image Name option and add the following name:

[source,shell]
----
quay.io/ilawson/oconline:latest
----

Click btn:[Search] and then leave the default values in the metadata form and click btn:[Deploy]

Once the image has deployed and a Pod will appear

* Click on the Pod ring (blue)
* Select `Terminal` from the options (This will be _your terminal_ you can use to do `oc` commands)

TIP: It might be easier to keep this project with the terminal view open in a separate browser tab, so that you  can switch back and forth to it easy

[[setup-login]]
=== Using your terminal (Both options)

If this document refer to _your terminal_ it will either be on your localhost or the docker install terminal depending your option above.

* In the Web Console, select the top right pulldown, choose btn:[Copy Login Command]

image::screenshot_copy_login.png[Deploy image]

* Paste that command into _your terminal_, hit return - hit ‘y’ for insecure access

Make sure `oc` is working, type:

[source,shell]
----
oc whoami
oc version
----
